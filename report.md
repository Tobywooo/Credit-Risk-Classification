# Module 20 Report

## Overview of the Analysis

This activity was to train and evaluate machine learning models using financial information as predictors for loan risk. In order to train the learning models, the data was split into training and testing sets, created labels and features, and trained on a logistic regression model. Then, predictions were made on the test data and overall performance of the model was evaluated based on accuracy scores. 

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
   * F1 score for healthy loan is 100%
   * F1 score for high risk loan is 88%
   * Precision score for a healthy loan is 100%
   * Precision score for a high risk loan is 85%
   * Recall score for healthy loan is 99%
   * Recall score for high risk loan is 91%
 
  
* Machine Learning Model 2:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
   * F1 score for healthy loan is 99%
   *Precision Score for healthy loan is 100%
   * Precision score for a high risk loan is 85%
   * Recall score for both healthy and high loan are 99%
 
## Summary


Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

Machine learning model 2 seems to be better due to the higher accuracy and recall scores.
